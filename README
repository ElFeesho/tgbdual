TGB Dual is an open source (GPLv2) GB/GBC emulator with game link cable support.

libretro_ui
-----------

This is a port of TGB Dual to libretro. To emulate two units side by side, use
your frontend's "Sufami Turbo" interface, placing the ROMs in "slots" A and B.
The Sufami Turbo BIOS itself can be any file; it is ignored by the emulator.
Use the Player 1 and Player 2 controllers to control each unit.

In addition, some of the Japanese comments in the source code have been run
through Google Translate to English, and CP932 and EUC-JP encoded files have
been converted to UTF-8.

(by libertyernie)
This is an update of TGB Dual designed primarily to get it compiling and
working correctly on new computers.

Branches: (https://github.com/libertyernie/tgbdual)
* The "master" branch contains all the bugfixes, new features (except for
  goombasav), and English-language dialogs/menus.
* The "japanese" branch uses the original Japanese text (features that I added
  later are still in English.)
* The "goombasav" branch has support for Goomba/Goomba Color ROMs, and will
  also have support for Goomba's SRAM data format once I get around to it.

See docs/README_2014.txt for a changelist.
