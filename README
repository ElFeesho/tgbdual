TGB Dual is an open source (GPLv2) GB/GBC emulator with game link cable support.

(by libertyernie)
This is an update of TGB Dual designed to:
* get the program to compile and run on new computers
* add an English translation
* add support for Goomba / Goomba Color ROMs and save files (if you want to
  run these ROMs on your PC, they run much faster in a GB emulator than in
  a GBA emulator that itself emulates a GB!)

Branches: (https://github.com/libertyernie/tgbdual)
* The "master" branch contains all the bugfixes, English-language dialogs
  and menus, and new features. This includes automatic support for Goomba ROMS
  (see docs/goomba.txt.)
* The "japanese" branch contains the above, but uses the original Japanese
  text (features that I added later are still in English.)

**See docs/README_2014.txt for more information.**

GIT NOTE:
All source code is now encoded in UTF-8 instead of Shift-JIS, which should
enable Japanese text to display on any computer. However, Windows uses UTF-16
and Git uses UTF-8, so I wrote a tiny program (endian_conv) that runs before
TGB_Dual is built and when it the project is cleaned, to get the files
encoded correctly. (When you make a Git commit, you should first clean the
project in Visual Studio.)

This is a port of TGB Dual to libretro. To emulate two units side by side, use
your frontend's "Sufami Turbo" interface, placing the ROMs in "slots" A and B.
The Sufami Turbo BIOS itself can be any file; it is ignored by the emulator.
Use the Player 1 and Player 2 controllers to control each unit.

In addition, some of the Japanese comments in the source code have been run
through Google Translate to English, and CP932 and EUC-JP encoded files have
been converted to UTF-8.
