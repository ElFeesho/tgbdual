TGB Dual is an open source (GPLv2) GB/GBC emulator with game link cable support.

libretro_ui
-----------

This is a port of TGB Dual to libretro. To emulate two units side by side, use
your frontend's "Sufami Turbo" interface, placing the ROMs in "slots" A and B.
The Sufami Turbo BIOS itself can be any file; it is ignored by the emulator.
Use the Player 1 and Player 2 controllers to control each unit.

In addition, some of the Japanese comments in the source code have been run
through Google Translate to English, and CP932 and EUC-JP encoded files have
been converted to UTF-8.

(by libertyernie)
This is an update of TGB Dual designed primarily to get it compiling and
working correctly on new computers.

Branches: (https://github.com/libertyernie/tgbdual)
* The "master" branch contains all the bugfixes, new features (except for
  goombasav), English-language dialogs/menus, and Goomba ROM/SRAM support.
* The "japanese" branch uses the original Japanese text (features that I added
  later are still in English.)

All source code is now Unicode instead of using the local code page, which
should enable Japanese text to display on any computer. However, Windows uses
UTF-16 and Git uses UTF-8, so I wrote a tiny program (endian_conv) that runs
before TGB_Dual is built and when it the project is cleaned, to get the files
encoded correctly. (When you make a Git commit, you should first clean the
project in Visual Studio.)

See docs/README_2014.txt for a changelist.
