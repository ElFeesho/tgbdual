TGB Dual is an open source (GPLv2) GB/GBC emulator with game link cable support.

libretro_ui
-----------

This is a port of TGB Dual to libretro. To emulate two units side by side, use
your frontend's "Sufami Turbo" interface, placing the ROMs in "slots" A and B.
The Sufami Turbo BIOS itself can be any file; it is ignored by the emulator.
Use the Player 1 and Player 2 controllers to control each unit.

In addition, some of the Japanese comments in the source code have been run
through Google Translate to English, and CP932 and EUC-JP encoded files have
been converted to UTF-8.

(by libertyernie)
This is an update of TGB Dual designed primarily to get it compiling and
working correctly on new computers.

Changes made:
* The program now uses the DirectInput 8 API, not the old one which isn't
  available anymore.
* Minor bugfix: turbo mode is now off by default.
* All text files are now Unicode instead of using the local code page, which
  should enable Japanese text to display on any computer.
  * However, Windows uses UTF-16 and Git uses UTF-8. So I wrote a tiny program
    (endian_conv) that runs before and after TGB_Dual is built, and on project
    clean, so get the files encoded correctly.
  * I'm still working on changing Windows API dialogs to use UTF-16 strings,
    instead of UTF-8.

Additions:
* The "english" branch in Git contains an English-language version of the app.
  This is also still a work in progess. Someday, this may be merged into the
  main branch and a "japanese" branch might be created.
