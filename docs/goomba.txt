** Using Goomba / Goomba Color ROMs **

Goomba and Goomba Color are Game Boy emulators for the Game Boy Advance. This
version of TGB Dual can load Goomba ROMs, and read and write Goomba save data.

First, you should go to Options -> Directories. Set the save directory to the
folder where your Goomba .sav files are stored. (You should also set the slot2
SRAM extension to "sav" instead of "sa2" - just don't run the same ROM in both
windows.)

Then, you can open the Goomba / Goomba Color ROM with TGB Dual. The program
will go through every Game Boy ROM found in the file, asking whether you want
to load that ROM. Press "Yes" to load it or "No" to see what the next ROM is.

Notes:
* If no Goomba save file exists, TGB Dual will create a regular Game Boy
  save file - which is probably not what you want!
* TGB Dual can only save to a Goomba .sav file if the .sav file already contains
  save data for the game you are playing.
