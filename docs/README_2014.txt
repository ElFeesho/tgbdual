TGB Dual - libertyernie's version

README_2014.txt last updated: May 26, 2014

This is a version of TGB Dual (original site: http://gigo.retrogames.com/download.html#tgb-dual) that fixes at least one bug and compiles on Visual Studio 2013 using DirectInput 8.
The project is actually forked from https://github.com/libretro/tgbdual-libretro, and so the emulator core (gb_code) contains updates made for the libretro interface.

My English translation is available in the "english" branch, which should contain all changes from the master branch as well. If not, try merging them.
